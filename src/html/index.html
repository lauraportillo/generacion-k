            <p class="sectionA__description">In 2020, the architect Laurix Portillo began to study a new mysterious
                language called Javascript. Her
                intention was none other than to be part of the famous K expedition and start her career as a developer.
                This expedition would take her to ancient Egypt, where the archaeological remains of the tomb of Pharaoh
                Nekgikis V had just been discovered, which stood out for being a Opportunity-giving pharaoh to Egyptian
                junior developers 3000 years ago.

                A mysterious encrypted message needed to be solved: a phrase and a series of numbers raised the
                suspicions
                of archaeologists. The secret url, would lead us to the solution of the mystery.
                After long nights of study, Laurix Portillo found the enigma! In this repo, you can access the secret
                scripts.
